Goal
===

To make a 6 card matching game (3 pairs total).

UX Requirements
===

1. The cards should be in two rows of 3, face up (showing the symbol and word) (see the reference image 'sample_game_starting.png')
1. When a user clicks on a card, the card should get slightly bigger to give a visual cue that it is 'active'.
1. A user should be able to match a picture to it's corresponding word (i.e. a picture of an umbrella with the word umbrella.)
1. If a user gets a successful match, then they should get a success message from the game (i.e. 'Nice Job!')
1. If a user gets a incorrect match then they should get a message of encouragement (i.e. Sorry Try Again.)
1. If the match was successful, the cards should be removed (see the reference image 'sample_game_correct_pair_gone.png')
1. If the match wasn't successful, the cards should go back to their original size.
1. When users have gotten all the matches then they should get a congratulations message (i.e. 'Great Job!').

Technical Requirements
===

1. Should function the same in Firefox and Chrome.
1. Should be primarily HTML, CSS, and JS.
1. The game should use the provided JSON.
1. The game should be 100% functional.
